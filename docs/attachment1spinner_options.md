# Attachment 1, Spinner options

The spinner contains the following options to label your measurement. These are dutch moments of the day that are common moments for diabetics to measure their bloodsugar.

VO – “Voor Ontbijt” or: before breakfast

NO – “Na Ontbijt” or: after breakfast

VL – “Voor Lunch” or: before lunch

NL – “Na Lunch” or: after lunch

VA – “Voor Avondeten” or: before dinner

NA – “Na Avondeten” or: after dinner

VS – “Voor Slapen” or: before going to sleep.

Extra – this is de default option on the spinner, for the people who don’t want to label their measurements or are to lazy to do it, it will only say the time of the day. It is also for extra measurements, for example when you’re feeling a hyper or hypo (a high or low bloodglucose) on a certain time that isn’t one of these moments.
