# How to Implement this App
NB: while this document is in English, the app will be in Dutch.
For each activity, different functions and databases are needed, they are described here.

## Advanced Sketch
In this sketch the interactions between the activities are easy to see. You can also see what activity uses what data source.
![Advanced Design, with interactions and file names](docs/design2.jpg)

## Register/ Log in activity
In this Activity you register as a user or as a parent. If you already have an account, you just log in.

If you're a parent, you can couple your phone to your child's, and then you can see your childs logbook. This logbook is read from the firebase database.

If you're a "normal" user, you go to the main activity.

## Logbook
*For the parents*
Pop Up screen: connect to child's app by giving his username and a secret code
Get an alert if your child enters a new measurement.
ListView of your child's bloodsugars.
Maybe: Send your child a reminder to check their bloodsugar.

## Main Activity
Add new measurements, gain XP. (Update database.) See old measurements.
Listeners for swipes are to be implemented here. If that won't work or is to hard i need to go back to something with buttons.

Maybe: making this activity available for when you have no internet connection.
Maybe: Set an alarm for when to check your next bloodsugar.

## Snack Ideas
This would need a new database. (This is possible in firebase.)
A database made and used by the users; you can add a snack and the amount of carbs.
Filter the snacks at carbs and/or sugar based on your latest measurement, if you're low: sugar, if you're high, just cucumber ;-).

## Pokeshop
Buy pokemons from your XP. Get a pop-up to ask are you sure to buy this pokémon? If yes, distract XP and add Pokemon to your database. 
Update the owned pokemons.

The pokémon come from an API : http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/, for example. The 1 is a variable, 1 stands for pokémon one, that is, Bulbasaur.

### My Garden
See your pokemon living happy in a landscape. (Maybe later let the users buy different landscapes?)
(Let the user see there pokemons in ImageViews, and let them change the pokemon to another one by clicking on the pokemon.)
